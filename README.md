# JavaChat
Java Chat application made with JavaFX. Currently, seems to only support local chatting through LAN.

## Quick How-To on JavaChat
JavaChat can only be run from the command line as of now. Run one instance of the application, and select Server, preferably with the default settings. Defaultly creates a Server running on localhost at port 5000.

Next, run a seperate instance of the application as a Client. Select the default options if you selected them for the Server, unless you chose otherwise. Type in a nickname, and you should see the JavaChat client!

You can run as many clients as you wish; each client logged into the same server will be able to interact within the same chat.
